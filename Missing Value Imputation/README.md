# Multiply Robust Nonparametric Multiple Imputation (MRNM)

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the effectiveness of the Multiply Robust Nonparametric Multiple Imputation (MRNM) method for handling missing data in datasets. Missing data is a pervasive issue in data analysis, and imputation methods are essential for ensuring robust and accurate analyses. This project specifically compares the MRNM method against other common imputation methods: MICE, Amelia, and mean imputation.

## Motivation

Handling missing values is critical for maintaining the integrity and reliability of data analyses. This project aims to explore the MRNM method's performance and compare it to other established imputation techniques. By doing so, we hope to identify the most effective approach for dealing with missing data.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation

The dataset used is an open-source House dataset from Kaggle, containing 4,308 observations of seven variables: number of bedrooms, net square meters, distance from downtown, distance from metro, floor, age, and price. Missing values were systematically imposed on each variable at three levels (10%, 33%, and 50%) using the delete MCAR() function in R.

### Imputation Methods

1. **MRNM (Multiply Robust Nonparametric Multiple Imputation):** This method involves multiple imputations using standardized scores and bootstrap samples to estimate missing values.
2. **MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations):** A widely-used method capable of handling various data types, including continuous and categorical data.
3. **Amelia:** Utilizes time series techniques for imputing missing data.
4. **Mean Imputation:** A basic method replacing missing values with the mean of observed values, used as a baseline in this project.

### Evaluation

The performance of each imputation method was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) across different variables and missingness levels.

## Results

The table below summarizes the RMSE values for each method and variable at different missingness levels:

## Key Findings

- **MRNM Performance:** The MRNM method generally outperformed other methods, providing the lowest RMSE in most scenarios.
- **Error Trends:** All methods showed increased error with higher proportions of missing data, as expected.
- **Variable Sensitivity:** Variables with lower ranges (e.g., bedroom count, floor) showed higher RMSE at higher missingness levels.

## Conclusions

This project demonstrates that the MRNM method is a robust and effective technique for imputing missing values compared to traditional methods like MICE, Amelia, and mean imputation. The results highlight the importance of choosing appropriate imputation strategies to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis.
